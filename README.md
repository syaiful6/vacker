Docker on vagrant using Docker provisioner and docker-compose-plugin.

This is ideal for me when wants to distribute my application/service. Or for anyone
trying to learn Docker.

First intall vagrant plugin required:

### install
clone this repo, then:

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-docker-compose
vagrant up
```

The repo was based Laravel Homestead.
